NNTPChan (previously known as overchan) is a decentralized imageboard that uses nntp to synchronize content between many different servers. It utilizes cryptographically signed posts to perform optional/opt-in decentralized moderation.

This repository contains resources used by the core daemon which is located [here](https://github.com/majestrate/srndv2) along with general documentation, [here](doc/)

## getting started ##

After you [built and installed the daemon](doc/build.md) and [set up your database](doc/database.md), clone this repository and start up the daemon

    # clone it
    git clone https://github.com/majestrate/nntpchan ~/nntpchan
    # get the latest stable release
    cd ~/nntpchan/
    git checkout tags/0.2.1

    # set up the workspace
    srndv2 setup

    # run the daemon
    srndv2 run


Then open http://127.0.0.1:18000/ukko.html in your browser.

*PLEASE* report any bugs you find while setting up or building [(here)](https://github.com/majestrate/nntpchan/issues) so that the problems get fixed (^:
