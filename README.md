NNTPChan
========

**NNTPChan** (previously known as overchan) is a decentralized imageboard that uses the [NNTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol) (network-news protocol) to synchronize content between many different servers. It utilizes cryptographically signed posts to perform optional/opt-in decentralized moderation.

This repository contains resources used by the core daemon which is located on [github](https://github.com/majestrate/srndv2) (for now) along with general documentation, [here](doc/)
