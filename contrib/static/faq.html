        <div>Question: What is nntpchan?</div>
        <div>NNTPCchan is a federated imageboard that spans across several networks including tor, i2p and anonet. There are no central servers so that as long as 1 server is left the forum will continue to function.</div>
      </p>

        <div>Question: How is this different from *chan? </div>
        <div>NNTPChan is by design invulnerable to global censorship. All moderation is local to each server.</div>
      </p>

      <p>
        <div>Question: How does moderation work then? </div>
        <div>Moderation is done with our special tripcodes (ed25519-sha512 signed posts). Anyone can give moderation suggestions, but that doesn't mean anyone will accept them. Those who trust the actions of a moderator can have their frontend whitelist the moderation actions and have them performed without oversight by another moderator.</div>

        <div>Question: How can I remove content from nntpchan completely? </div>
        <div>‾\(._.)/‾ I don't know. You probably can't unless every server agrees to remove the content, even then, nothing prevents someone from reposting it. You can't delete what you post on the internet.</div>

        <div>Question: Do you allow XYZ content? </div>
        <div>If it violates USA Law or causes problems with my host, no. Otherwise, yes. <b>All posts on this site are the responsibility of the individual poster and not the administration of this server</b>.</div>
